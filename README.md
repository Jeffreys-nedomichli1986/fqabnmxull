Man, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Amateur and I'm still sitting here like, what the heck did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? 😂 It's like it tried so hard to be deep but I don't even know if it succeeded or not. You know what I mean? The main dude was something else, seriously, and I swear his expressions said more than the dialogue half the time. Is it just me, or do they throw in those moody silences just to mess with your head?

So the plot kicks off with this dude who's like, supposed to be all intense and mysterious but sometimes, I just wanted to scream like, just communicate, bro! 😂 And oh man, that scene where he figures things out, it's like you expect this big eureka moment... but nah, it’s more of a huh, okay then vibe. But I guess that’s life, right? Not every discovery is fireworks and explosions.

> There was this one part, no spoilers, but it felt like it was trying to be all artsy and clever and instead, ended up like one of those weird indie  s you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 just because the poster looked kinda cool. And maybe it was just the tired eyes talking? Who knows? 🤷‍♂️ But yeah, I guess some directors just have way too much fun with their artistic license. Like, can we just, I don't know, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and get it, instead of needing a brain workout?

And don't even get me started on the ending! It's like they dropped it and ran out of there. What happened to closure, man? Or maybe it’s one of those deep messages about life being an unfinished story or something, who knows. But hey, the music was on point though—not gonna lie. Seriously, if the plot had been as good as the soundtrack, we’d have a winner right here.

So yeah, my brain's still reeling. I might just have to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again or maybe check out some reviews to see if I’m missing something. Anyway, I'm spent. Gonna hit the hay and let my subconscious make sense of it all. Talk tomorrow?
